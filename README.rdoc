Gender Guesser takes in your height and weight and guesses your gender based on previous user's data and sample data from (http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v11n2/datasets.heinz.html).

In order to make the app's guesses improve over time, I used LIBSVM, a library for Support Vector Machines (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/). Specifically, I used the Ruby port of the LIBSVM Python SWIG (Simplified Wrapper and Interface Generator) found at https://github.com/tomz/libsvm-ruby-swig/tree/master. When time permits, I'd like to investigate the inner workings of LIBSVM moving forward and preprocess my data to improve accuracy.

In doing this project, I ended up investigating many different methods of machine learning. I went from very ignorant to less than very ignorant and here are a couple of resources I found useful:

To run locally:
  1) git clone https://github.com/BraydenCleary/gender_guesser.git
  2) cd gender_guesser
  3) bundle install
  4) rake db:migrate
  5) rake db:seed
  6) rails s -p 3000
  7) visit localhost:3000 in your browser

Suggestions for improvement are appreciated!
