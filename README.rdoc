Gender Guesser takes in your height and weight and guesses your gender based on previous user's data and sample data from (http://www.amstat.org/publications/jse/v11n2/datasets.heinz.html).

To run locally:
  1) git clone https://github.com/BraydenCleary/gender_guesser.git
  2) cd gender_guesser
  3) bundle install
  4) rake db:migrate
  5) rake db:seed
  6) rails s -p 3333

Suggestions for improvement are appreciated!
